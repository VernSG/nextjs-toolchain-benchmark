Project Type    : Default create-next-app template

================================================================================
2. METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Metric Measured : Cold Start Time (ms)
                  Time from `npm run dev` execution until "Ready in Xms" log appears.

Cache Control   : `.next` build cache deleted before each run to ensure cold start.
Detection       : Automated regex parsing via measure_start.js script.
Sampling Rate   : 100ms (0.1s) for system resource monitoring.
Cooldown        : 5 seconds between consecutive runs.
Sample Size     : n = 5 runs per bundler mode.

B. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Legacy          Turbopack
                            ------          ---------
    Mean (Average)      :   1197.0 ms       574.6 ms
    Standard Deviation  :     53.3 ms        22.0 ms
    Minimum             :   1155.0 ms       561.0 ms
    Maximum             :   1289.0 ms       616.0 ms
    Range               :    134.0 ms        55.0 ms

C. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Absolute Difference : 1197.0 - 574.6 = 622.4 ms faster

    Speedup Factor      : 1197.0 / 574.6 = 2.08x faster

    Speedup Percentage  : ((1197.0 - 574.6) / 1197.0) × 100
                        = (622.4 / 1197.0) × 100
                        = 52.0% reduction in cold start time

================================================================================
4. TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

4.1 SAMPLING RATE ADJUSTMENT
    The original 1-second sampling interval was insufficient for capturing
    Turbopack's rapid startup behavior. Since Turbopack consistently completed
    cold starts in under 700ms, a 100ms sampling rate was adopted to ensure
    adequate data granularity for system resource monitoring.

4.2 CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS
    Turbopack exhibited superior consistency with a standard deviation of
    only 22.0ms compared to Legacy's 53.3ms. This indicates more predictable
    and stable performance characteristics.

    Coefficient of Variation (CV):
    - Legacy    : (53.3 / 1197.0) × 100 = 4.45%
    - Turbopack : (22.0 / 574.6) × 100 = 3.83%

4.3 PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
    - Both bundlers showed minimal variance across 5 runs, indicating
      reliable and reproducible measurements.
    - Turbopack's maximum time (616ms) is still faster than Legacy's
      minimum time (1155ms) by 539ms.
    - The performance gap is consistent across all runs.

4.4 DATA RELIABILITY
    All measurements were conducted under controlled conditions:
    - Clean cache state before each run
    - Automated detection to eliminate human timing errors
    - Sufficient cooldown period between runs

================================================================================
5. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Turbopack demonstrates a statistically significant performance improvement
over the legacy Webpack bundler, achieving a 52.0% reduction in cold start
time (from 1197.0ms to 574.6ms average). This represents a 2.08x speedup
in development server initialization, with Turbopack also exhibiting lower
variance and more consistent startup times across multiple runs.

The results confirm that Turbopack provides measurable benefits for
developer experience in Next.js development workflows on Apple Silicon
hardware.
